MVSMDA: Multi-view and multi-scale attentional feature fusion for microRNA-diseaseÂ associations prediction
To better predict miRNA-disease association, we propose a novel computational method called MVSMDA. These methods can not only improve the accuracy of miRNA-disease association but also provide more effective means for disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.This repository contains codes and datas for MVSMDA model.
